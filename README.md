## About ##

- Minishell is a project at school 42 and the instructions were given in the [subject](https://github.com/anolivei/Minishell42/blob/main/subject.pdf).

- The objective of this project is to create a simple shell to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

- The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.
With Minishell, you‚Äôll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn‚Äôt exist.
